Group Work Distribution
👤 Member 1: Lead UI/UX Developer

Focus: The visual interface and user interaction.

Main Window & Canvas: Create the primary application window and the central display area for images.

Menu Bar: Implement the "File" (Open, Save, Exit) and "Edit" (Undo, Redo) menus.

Control Panel: Build the sidebar or button panel for all filter and effect options.

Status Bar: Implement a dynamic bar to show the filename and image dimensions.

Dialogs: Integrate message boxes for error handling and confirmation prompts.

👤 Member 2: Image Processing Specialist

Focus: Core image manipulation logic using OpenCV.

Basic Filters: Implement Grayscale conversion, Gaussian Blur, and Canny Edge Detection.

Adjustments: Code the logic for Brightness and Contrast adjustments.

Transformations: Create functions for 90/180/270-degree rotation and horizontal/vertical flipping.

Resizing: Implement the logic to scale images based on user input.

Slider Integration: Create at least one adjustable slider to control effect intensity (e.g., blur level).

👤 Member 3: Systems & Workflow Architect

Focus: OOP structure, file handling, and version control.

Class Architecture: Design and implement the at least three required classes (e.g., App, ImageProcessor, Toolbar) ensuring proper encapsulation and interaction.

File I/O: Implement file dialogs for opening and saving images in JPG, PNG, and BMP formats.

Undo/Redo System: Architect the logic to track image states for the "Undo" and "Redo" functionality.
