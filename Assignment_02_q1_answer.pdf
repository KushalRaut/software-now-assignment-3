Answer to the question 01:  

This program is designed to securely process text data by applying a custom character-based 
encryption and decryption technique to the contents of a text file. The program begins by 
prompting the user to enter two integer values, referred to as shift1 and shift2. These values control 
how much each character in the text is shifted during encryption and are essential for both 
encrypting and later decrypting the file. The program reads input from a file named raw_text.txt, 
ensuring support for multi-line text and UTF-8 encoding so that standard characters and formatting 
are preserved. 

The encryption process works by examining each character individually and applying different 
shifting rules depending on whether the character is lowercase, uppercase, or non-alphabetic. 
Lowercase letters are split into two alphabet ranges (a–m and n–z), with one group shifted forward 
and the other shifted backward using combinations of the user inputs. Uppercase letters follow a 
similar rule set but use different shift calculations, including squaring one of the input values. The 
program uses built-in Python methods such as ord() and chr() to convert characters into numeric 
values and back again, while modulo arithmetic (% 26) ensures that alphabet wrapping occurs 
correctly without exceeding letter boundaries. All non-letter characters such as spaces, numbers, 
and symbols remain unchanged. 

Decryption uses the reverse logic of the encryption rules, ensuring that the original text can be 
fully recovered when the same shift values are provided. After decryption, the program writes the 
result to decrypted_text.txt and then verifies correctness by comparing it directly with the original 
input file. If both files match exactly, the program confirms successful decryption. This approach 
demonstrates a simple yet effective symmetric encryption method, emphasizing file handling, 
character manipulation, and data integrity verification.
